# Smart

Smart React Native is a beautiful resource built over Native Base, React Native, and Expo allowing you to create powerful and beautiful Online Learning mobile applications. We have designed all the usual components in Native Base to make it look flat, minimalist, and easy to use.

## Installation

Our Smart React Native app and components are easy to use in order to configure it on your own and get it ready for production.

Make sure you have npm/yarn installed. After you've installed any of those, install expo by writing the following in your terminal console: `npm install -g expo-cli` (or `yarn global add expo-cli`, whichever you prefer).

Now you're all set up. Navigate your way into the project's directory and write `npm install or yarn install`. This will install all dependencies that Smart React Native needs in order to function properly.

With Expo installed, you can then run `yarn start` to launch the app.
